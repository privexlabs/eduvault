# EduVault

EduVault is an educational content marketplace that helps educators, students, and creators publish, license, sell, and manage access to learning materials.

The project combines a modern Next.js application with off-chain file storage, searchable marketplace data, and a planned Stellar/Soroban payment and entitlement layer for low-cost educational content transactions.

## Overview

Many educational resources are shared through informal channels such as WhatsApp groups, Telegram communities, and manual file transfers. This makes it difficult for creators to earn fairly, buyers to verify ownership, and institutions to manage trusted access.

EduVault provides a creator-first marketplace where learning materials can be uploaded, listed, discovered, purchased, and accessed securely.

## Core Features

- Creator profiles connected to wallet-based onboarding
- Educational material upload flow with thumbnail support
- IPFS-backed file and metadata storage through Pinata
- MongoDB-backed catalog and profile persistence
- Marketplace discovery and material detail pages
- Usage-rights and pricing metadata for each resource
- Planned Stellar-native checkout with XLM or supported Stellar assets
- Planned Soroban-based entitlement checks for protected downloads

## How It Works

1. A creator creates a profile and connects a wallet.
2. The creator uploads a learning material and optional cover image.
3. The file and metadata are pinned to IPFS.
4. The listing is stored in MongoDB and displayed in the marketplace.
5. A buyer discovers the resource and completes the checkout flow.
6. The app verifies access rights before allowing protected downloads.

## Tech Stack

### Current Stack

- Next.js 16
- React 19
- Tailwind CSS 4
- MongoDB
- Pinata/IPFS
- Nodemailer
- wagmi and RainbowKit
- Hardhat and OpenZeppelin for the archived EVM prototype

### Planned Stellar Additions

- Soroban smart contracts written in Rust
- Stellar SDK and RPC/Horizon clients
- Stellar wallet integration
- XLM and Stellar-based stable asset payments
- On-chain purchase entitlement records

### Current Repository State

- Frontend: Next.js App Router, React, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Next.js route handlers for uploads, profiles, and catalog operations
- Storage: MongoDB for profiles and marketplace metadata
- File persistence: IPFS pinning through Pinata
- Wallet prototype: wagmi, RainbowKit, WalletConnect, and Coinbase Wallet support
- Legacy contract: archived Solidity proof of concept in `archive/legacy-evm/`

## Legacy EVM Prototype

The repository includes an archived Solidity/Celo proof of concept under `archive/legacy-evm/`.

This legacy code is kept for historical reference and testing only. New blockchain work should target Stellar and Soroban.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm 10+ or pnpm
- MongoDB 7+ or Docker
- Pinata credentials for file uploads
- Wallet credentials for testing wallet-based flows

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Obiajulu-gif/eduvault.git
cd eduvault
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Start MongoDB locally with Docker:

```bash
docker compose up -d mongodb
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the app at:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

## Environment Variables

Use `.env.example` as the main reference for local configuration.

## Deployment Notes

- Production deployments must use real values for required secrets.
- Placeholder secrets should not be used in preview or production environments.
- Required production values include `JWT_SECRET`, `MONGODB_URI`, `PINATA_JWT`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_GATEWAY_URL`.
- Once Stellar features are enabled, production must also include valid Stellar RPC, Horizon, and contract configuration.

## Roadmap

### Near Term

- Clean up stale chain-specific UI references
- Improve creator onboarding and material publishing flows
- Finalize Soroban contract interfaces for registry and entitlement logic

### Next Milestone

- Add Stellar wallet support
- Deploy Soroban contracts to Stellar testnet
- Support XLM and USDC-based checkout
- Gate downloads based on on-chain entitlement state
- Add creator payout accounting

### Future Improvements

- Educator and institution verification
- Bulk licensing for schools and learning communities
- Institution-issued access assets and scholarship credits
- Creator analytics and reporting
- Mobile-first purchase flow for low-bandwidth environments
